## Tech Used

handlebars, css, javascript, node.js

## Motivation

I wanted to create a simple note taking application where the user can keep track of his notes for the week. I would personally use it as a weekly planner, but it is at heart a simple note taker so youre more than welcome to use it as you feel neccessary.

## GIVEN a note-taking application

```
WHEN I open the Music Genre Blog page
THEN I am presented with a homepage with already created posts from other users

WHEN I click on the link to signup / login
THEN I am presented with a login / singup page giving the user the option to either create a new profile or login if the user is already signed up

WHEN I am in my profile
THEN I am able to add and delete blog posts to the main blog homepage

WHEN I click on othe user's blog posts
THEN I am able to add or delete comments to the user's post

WHEN I click logout
THEN I am automattically logged out and brought back to the homepage where I can only VIEW other people's posts, but I can't add or delete a post or comments on other user's posts

```
